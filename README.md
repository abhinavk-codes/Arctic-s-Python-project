# Arctic's Python Project 🚀

This is my growing collection of beginner-to-intermediate Python programs developed as part of my self-learning journey.
I'm preparing for global CS programs such as NUS Singapore and building a portfolio for scholarships and applications.

## 📁 Folders

### 🔤 String_Programs
Programs involving string manipulation like reversing words, counting vowels, and more.

### 🔢 Number_Programs
Basic number operations like Armstrong number check, prime detection, and perfect numbers.

### 🔷 Pattern_Programs
Python-based pattern generation and pyramids for visual logic practice.

### 📊 Algorithms
Logic-based programs to strengthen control flow and algorithmic thinking.

### 🎮 Games
I've done a number guessing game, which prompts the user to guess a number from (1 to 100)
The game is fully functional and enjoyable. It tracks user attempts and supports replay.
Beginner game implementations — currently working on a word guessing game (WIP).

## 🧑‍💻 About Me
Hi, I’m Abhinav Krishna — an 11th-grade student from India, currently preparing for the JEE (Joint Entrance Examination) while independently learning Python programming.

Coding isn’t just a hobby for me — it’s a serious passion. I’m building this portfolio to strengthen my core CS skills and document my progress in real time.

My goal is to earn a Computer Science scholarship at a world-class university such as NUS, MIT, DAAD Germany.

This repository represents my self-driven journey — starting from basic logic building and progressing toward real-world projects like mini-apps and Python-based tools.
I believe in learning by doing, and building in public keeps me consistent, honest, and always improving.

Use GitHub to document and store my project and codes publicly
