🧊 Arctic's Python Project 🚀
Welcome to my growing collection of beginner-to-intermediate Python programs — built as part of my self-learning journey.

I'm currently preparing for global Computer Science programs like NUS Singapore, and using this repository as a portfolio for scholarships and university applications.

📁 Project Structure
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🔤 String_Programs/
Programs that manipulate strings — like reversing words, counting vowels, and more.

🔢 Number_Programs/
Basic number-based logic such as Armstrong number checks, prime detection, and perfect numbers.

🔷 Pattern_Programs/
Fun with loops! Visual pattern generation using stars, numbers, and creative shapes.

📊 Algorithms/
Logic and control-flow practice — including search-based problems and algorithmic challenges.

🎮 Games/
✅ Number Guessing Game — A classic game where users guess a number between 1 and 100. Tracks attempts, includes replay functionality.

🛠️ Word Guessing Game (Work in Progress) — Inspired by Hangman, this is my next game in development.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 3.8 → Currently using Python 3.11

IDE: PyCharm

AI-assisted brainstorming for problem generation (but code is 100% written by me)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🎯 My Learning Goals
Build mini apps and Python GUIs (Tkinter coming soon!)

Participate in Python-based coding competitions

Apply to top CS scholarship programs (NUS, DAAD, MIT, etc.)

👨‍💻 About Me
Hi! I’m Abhinav Krishna, an 11th-grade student from India 🇮🇳 preparing for JEE while self-learning Python in parallel.

Coding isn't just a hobby — it's a serious passion.
This repository tracks my hands-on learning — from basic programs to real-world apps.

I believe in learning by doing, and this GitHub repo is my public journal to stay consistent, improve daily, and showcase my progress toward a global CS education.
