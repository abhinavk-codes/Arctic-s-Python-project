# Arctic's Python Project 🚀

This is my growing collection of beginner-to-intermediate Python programs developed as part of my self-learning journey.
I'm preparing for global CS programs such as NUS Singapore and building a portfolio for scholarships and applications.

## 📁 Folders

### 🔤 String_Programs
Programs involving string manipulation like reversing words, counting vowels, and more.

### 🔢 Number_Programs
Basic number operations like Armstrong number check, prime detection, and perfect numbers.

### 🔷 Pattern_Programs
Python-based pattern generation and pyramids for visual logic practice.

### 📊 Algorithms
Logic-based programs to strengthen control flow and algorithmic thinking.

### 🎮 Games
Explore two terminal-based Python mini-games in the `games/` directory:

### 🔢 Number Guessing Game
Guess the secret number! The program gives hints after each try.  
  Features :
- 1 to 100 number range
- Attempt tracking
- Feedback on every guess

### ✊ Rock-Paper-Scissors
Play against the computer with clean input handling and score tracking.  
  Features :
- Case-insensitive commands (`rock`, `Rock`, `ROCK`, etc.)
- Keeps score for both sides
- Option to replay after each round (`y` for yes, anything else for no)
- Fun ASCII visuals to enhance gameplay (SOON!)

- All games are built in Python and run directly in the terminal. No external packages needed.
- Beginner game implementations — currently working on a word guessing game (WIP).

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python 3.8 (currently on Python 3.11)
- PyCharm IDE
- AI for problem generation and refinement (not for writing final code)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📌 Goals
- Build mini-apps and GUIs soon
- Participate in Python-based competitions
- Apply for CS scholarships: NUS, DAAD, etc.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me
Hi, I’m Abhinav Krishna — an 11th-grade student from India, currently preparing for the JEE (Joint Entrance Examination) while independently learning Python programming.

Coding isn’t just a hobby for me — it’s a serious passion. I’m building this portfolio to strengthen my core CS skills and document my progress in real time.

My goal is to earn a Computer Science scholarship at a world-class university such as NUS, MIT, DAAD Germany.

This repository represents my self-driven journey — starting from basic logic building and progressing toward real-world projects like mini-apps and Python-based tools.
I believe in learning by doing, and building in public keeps me consistent, honest, and always improving.

Use GitHub to document and store my project and codes publicly
